# MindConnect MQTT

Sample python code for getting started to securely connect your MindConnect MQTT on-site devices in a saleable manner to Insights Hub. 

By cloning or downloading this repository, you accept the Development License Agreement, which can be found at https://documentation.mindsphere.io/MindSphere/license.html 

## Features

- Use mqtt certificates to connect to Insights Hub. 
- Use Asset Modeler for model creation and instantiation.
- Ingesting timeseries data, events and uploading files to Insights Hub. 


## Configuration Steps

### Creating Certificates
The certificates needs to be generated before connecting the device to MQTT Broker. Below documentation guides through creation of MQTT certificates. 

https://documentation.mindsphere.io/MindSphere/howto/howto-managing-ca-certificates.html

The generated certificates needs to be placed in the `agent_cert` folder.

### Updating agent configuration
The configuration for connecting the client to MQTT Broker should be updated before starting the client. 
Below config properties should contain valid values:
- CLIENT_ID: client id for the agent 
- DEVICE_NAME: same as client id
- TENANT_ID: tenant id 
- DEVICE_CERT_PATH: relative path for the device certificate
- DEVICE_KET_PATH: relative path for the device key

### Installation

Install Python latest version and install the dependencies using below command. 
run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Place the certificates in the `agent_cert` folder. 
Update the `config.json` file from folder `configs` with valid values.


### Creating Asset Model and Instantiation
This example provides sample to create Asset Model and Instantiate it to create the aspects, asset types and assets along with the mappings. 

For asset modeler instance to be created, delete the `instance.conf` file for the first run (If Present).

Run Asset Modeler for creation of model. 
Command: `python AssetModelCreator.py`
Click on the button `create model`. 

After model is created, the instance will be created automatically on start-up of the agent. 

It uses the file `instance.conf` to check if the instance was created. The file should not exist if instance is not created.

### Starting Agent

Run the agent python file `MindConnectClient.py` for the connection to be established.

Command: `python MindConnectClient.py`

We should get connected status `0` after the client starts running.
